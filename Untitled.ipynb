    "    When choosing a neighborhood, considering fire incidents is essential as they reflect the area's safety and quality of life. High fire frequencies may suggest safety risks, including outdated infrastructure or insufficient fire prevention measures. The presence of an efficient and responsive fire department is crucial for ensuring safety and protecting property. Additionally, fire incidents can influence insurance premiums, with higher rates in areas with more frequent fires. Therefore, the rate and handling of fire incidents offer valuable insights into a neighborhood's safety, emergency readiness, and overall living conditions, making it a key factor in selecting an ideal place to reside."
